# Software Requirements

## Vision
To-do lists not only help you arrange your life schedules but also help you discover your unfulfilled wishes. It is not always possible to carry a pen and pencil wherever you go to note down your desires or tasks to-do list.

## Problem domain
Do you often feel completely overwhelmed with the amount of work you’ve got to do? Or you sometimes forget to do things that are important and people have to chase you to get things done.
Also, you find it a struggle to keep to deadlines. Luckily, there is something very simple you can do to keep your life and work more organized by using `WhatToDo`. Which is a list of tasks you need to complete, or things that you want to do.
 
## Importance of this project
One of the most important reasons you should use a to do list is that it will help you stay organised. When you write all your tasks in a list, they seem more manageable. When you’ve got a clear outline of the tasks you’ve got to do and those you’ve completed, it helps you stay focused.

## Non-Functional Requirements
### Security 
Use Intents for IPC, use sockets, named pipes, or shared files to  synchronously communicate with other apps installed on an Android device. These approaches are not only hard and inelegant, but also prone to threats. An easier and more secure approach to interprocess communication on the Android operating system is to use intents.
 
### performance
The application should run fast with no propagation, in order to provide the best services for all users.
