# Conflict Plan :
- We always hope that we do not face any conflicts, however, things happen, but we have planned our way through all of these issues. Most importantly, we will always try to keep an open mindset, we plan to make a vote in case we face something that might cause everymember to have a differnt opinion, and we all agreed to go with the one that wins the most votes. But to resolve real conflicts, we agreed on trying to solve the issue rationally and by discussing and taking into consideration the opinion of the conflicting members, but in case this does not work, we agreed to relay the message to the instructional team after trying and trying to solve the issue internally.

- Again, we plan to make many meetings on differnt topics or themes, so some of them will focus mostly on checking the mental progress or if all members are following though the project, to make sure that all of us are on the same page, and we will all be available if someone faces an issue or a misunderstanding for some concept or task.

- Although I am the team leader, it does not mean that I am on a higher level or that I have some extra priviliges, but instead it is a responsibility, and I must also be questioned in case I do not do my job as expected, and this is also expected to be done to anyone who does not contribute as expected, knowing that we will take into consideration the differences and the cabapilites of each single member, and we are always ready to cover up for any one of us in case he shows a lack of specific skills, knowing that we will try to help them understand and focus on thier other strengths.

- In case a conflict does not get solved after some time to the point it affects the flow of work, we will escalate that to the instructional team within 6 hours of the time of that conflict.


# Communication Plan :

* The team has agreed on keeping all communication channels or means avaialable all the time, however, when anyone has an urgent task or an emergency, we agreed on execusing them. We will be using mostly Zoom for meetings, and sometimes Discord, we have also created a WhatsApp group for things that require immediate response.

* We left the timing of breaks to be flexible, so that we utilize the time when all of us are in a good mood and energy to the maximum, in addition to the fact that sometimes leaving breaks to be strictly planned might couse the one to lose focus especially if they do not feel like taking a break, knowing that it is ok for anyone to leave in thte middle of a discussion if he or she really needs to and we agreed to recap everything until they come back unless the dicussion is about something that is so important.

* If we start to fall behind the schedule, we agreed to shorten the break time, and try to complete the tasks after working hours, so it is not a big of a problem to anyone to sacrifice their time to serve the team.

* To make sure that everyone feels comfortable, we agreed on avoid any persona judjments by anyone to anyone, we also agreed on taking into consideration the opinion of every member no matter how unimportant they think it is. We also assured ourselves that we are all in this together, so we succeed as a team or we fail as a team.

# Work Plan :

To start, we will let all the members explain themselves and talk about themselves freely, they will also describe what makes them more comfortable doing, and what are thier main skills especially the technical ones related to the project. After that, based on the outcome, we will break down the project into small pieces or parts, and make everyone handle even a smaller part of that part, so that no one feels like they are handling more than anyone else. This will also take into consideration the points discussed in the beginning.

We will be using Zoom and Trello to manage and organize our time and tasks, and sometimes just casually using any communication channel available like WhatsApp and Slack.

# Git Process :

Almost all of the components of our project will live on GitHub, especially code related things. We have already created an organization for out team, and we added the repositories that will contain the main project, all of the members have been added to that organization and have the access to modify and upload code and push thier latest work and once that is done, all of the team will pull that latest update to their local machine. We will try to make everyone work on a separate file at a time, except when doing pair programming, to avoid having conflicts as much as possible.
