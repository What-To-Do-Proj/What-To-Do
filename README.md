# Conflict Plan :
- We always hope that we do not face any conflicts, however, things happen, but we have planned our way through all of these issues. Most importantly, we will always try to keep an open mindset, we plan to make a vote in case we face something that might cause everymember to have a differnt opinion, and we all agreed to go with the one that wins the most votes. But to resolve real conflicts, we agreed on trying to solve the issue rationally and by discussing and taking into consideration the opinion of the conflicting members, but in case this does not work, we agreed to relay the message to the instructional team after trying and trying to solve the issue internally.

- Again, we plan to make many meetings on differnt topics or themes, so some of them will focus mostly on checking the mental progress or if all members are following though the project, to make sure that all of us are on the same page, and we will all be available if someone faces an issue or a misunderstanding for some concept or task.

- Although I am the team leader, it does not mean that I am on a higher level or that I have some extra priviliges, but instead it is a responsibility, and I must also be questioned in case I do not do my job as expected, and this is also expected to be done to anyone who does not contribute as expected, knowing that we will take into consideration the differences and the cabapilites of each single member, and we are always ready to cover up for any one of us in case he shows a lack of specific skills, knowing that we will try to help them understand and focus on thier other strengths.

- In case a conflict does not get solved after some time to the point it affects the flow of work, we will escalate that to the instructional team within 6 hours of the time of that conflict.

What-To-Do (approved).

This project is the least help we can give ourselves to organize our priorities and the most important work that we will do , we need to remind ourselves of the work that we must finish a little early and more than once. This project is based on facilitating the process of organizing our priorities and trying to ensure that they are completed on time faster than the usual methods by trying not to forget them or organize other work at the same time.

The minimum required is, The Users and Tasks should be linked in a simple and clear way. And the addition of operations that help determine the state of weather at the time of our required Task at the place where we want to do our work, it also provides a way to ensure that tasks is organized after done with them .
